      <description>&amp;ldquo;Gene drives&amp;rdquo; are alleles that spread through populations due to within-individual selection, instead of by increasing the fitness of individuals that carry them. For example, the genetic elements t and Segregation distorter occur naturally in mice and fruitflies respectively; they are able to spread through populations despite reducing the fitness of indiviuals that carry them because they &amp;ldquo;selfishly&amp;rdquo; ensure their own transmission to ~95% of the offspring of male heterozygotes. Gene drives can work in a variety of ways, including destroying sperm cells that do not carry them, biasing meiosis in females, or gene conversion (which essentially converts drive heterozygotes into homozygotes).</description>
